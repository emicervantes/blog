Hello :wave:

My name is Emi, and I am a third-year undergraduate student studying Mathematics with a concentration in Data Science at UC Irvine. I am currently working on a research project with [Dr. Anna Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/annama) on developing a new algorithm of Kaczmarz Methods for solving a large linear system. After completing my bachelorâ€™s degree, I plan to pursue a graduate degree in Statistics and become a Data Scientist.
