## Anime Recommendation and Genre Prediction

In this first Data Science project, I created models that predict genre of anime based on time it was aired and anime recommendation engine. The genre prediction model was built using Python's Scikit-learn LogisticRegression algorithm based on its review score and time it was aired. The anime recommendation engine was built based on a concept of cosine similarity algorithm. Lastly, I showcased my works by creating an interactive Streamlit website.
