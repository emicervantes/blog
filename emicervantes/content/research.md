## Improving Randomized Kaczmarz Methods for Large-Scale Linear Systems (On-going)

Kaczmarz Method is an iterative algorithm that solves large-scale linear systems by taking orthogonal projections onto linear space. We are looking at different variations of the Kaczmarz Method including the Randomized Kaczmarz Method, Motzkinâ€™s Method (Greedy Kaczmarz), and Sampling Kaczmarz Method (SKM) by implementing and testing each method with randomized Gaussian matrices. Our goal is to develop a new algorithm that improves traditional Kaczmarz Methods in terms of time and cost by measuring its CPU and floating-point operations (FLOP).

## Impact of Mediterranean and DASH Diets on MPN Symptoms 

Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) is cancer located within the blood and bone marrow. To address the range of symptoms that occur, 24 MPN patients' symptom scores (TSS) were gathered over the course of 112 days. The Mediterranean and DASH diets were utilized for their focus on preventing cardiovascular disease, composed of whole grains, fruits, seafood, vegetables, and nuts. We used the linear mixed model to predict TSS for each individual patient, and our findings based on this model suggested that both diets have a significant impact in bettering the MPN symptoms, but there was no evidence to suggest that one diet is better than the other.

## Adaptive Therapy: Cancer Treatment and Development of Resistance 

Adaptive therapy is a type of cancer treatment that undergoes period of chemo therapy followed by "drug holiday", period of time when patients stop taking treatment. This type of treatment is effective in stabilizing the growth rate of tumor cell. We are using population growth ODE models for both susceptible/sensitive tumor cells and resistant tumor cells, with different therapy conditions. To test our conditions, we created a simulation for the ODE model, which allowed us to see changes in cell growth between different factors.
